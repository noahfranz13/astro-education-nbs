    "1. This is called a \"Jupyter Notebook\" (said like Jupiter Notebook). It is a common tool used by astronomers to write and develop code for their research, primarily for looking at data. It runs Python code in small blocks, each like a mini program.  \n",
    "2. Each block of code is called a \"cell\", to run a cell you can click into it with your mouse and press `Shift-Enter`.\n",
    "3. When you run a cell, some will output plots/figures or text at the bottom of them. This will give you some information about the code and color magnitude diagrams. Other cells won't have any output, and that's okay!\n",
    "4. You may not understand fully what the code is doing and that is *totally okay*! This is as much about the astronomy as it is the code. Our goal for this notebook is to provide a soft introduction to Python code for those who have never seen it.\n",

    "At a fundamental level, Python functions and mathematical equations are very similar. They take in a number of arguments, do some operations on them, and produce a value. Unfortunately, Python can't read mathematical notation directly, so even though the parts and the process are the same, the presentation is a bit different.\n",

    "One of the major differences between Python and handwritten equations is that to actually do calculations in Python you need to use existing libraries of mathematical functions to do some basic calculations. `NumPy` is one of the most commonly used Python libraries for doing these calculations. Some useful `NumPy` functions are:\n",
    "1. `np.sqrt(x)`: The square root of the number in the parantheses. In algebraic notation you would see this as $f(x) = \\sqrt{x}$.\n",
    "2. `np.power(x,y)`: Raises the first number to the power of the second number inside the parantheses. In algebraic notation, you would see this as $f(x,y) = x^y$. (Interestingly, the results of the `np.sqrt` function can also come from `np.power(x, 1/2)`. Why is this? Why have two functions?)\n",
    "3. `np.log10(x)`: Takes the base 10 logarithm of the number in the parantheses. In algebraic notation, you would see this as $log_{10}\\left(x\\right)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `NumPy` functions are usually called using the abbreviation `np`. So before using any NumPy function you preface it with a `np.` If you want to learn more abotu `NumPy` you should go checkout their very extensive documentation: https://numpy.org/\n",

    "trimmed and/or cleaned the raw data to represent stars that are only in\n",
    "the cluster M67.\n",
    "\n",
    "We started with all of the data from Gaia, a space based telescope that\n",
    "is surveying starts within the entire Milky Way and parts of nearby\n",
    "galaxies. We then made the following cuts on the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We performed what is called a \"cone search\", in which you define the radius\n",
    "   of a disk, or patch, of space that you will select of the objects from in\n",
    "   the dataset. You can imagine that narrowing this radius\n",

    "   definitely play around with the cone search radius with your research\n",
    "   below! \n",
    "2. You can imagine that, since the stars in a cluster are gravitationally\n",
    "   bound, all of them should be moving relative to Gaia's line of sight at about the same\n",
    "   velocity with some small amount of deviation. This allows us to tune\n",
    "   two other parameters: \n",

    "       or away from Earth (or Gaia). We can set an upper and lower limit on this to\n",
    "       find stars that are moving similar to each other. \n",
    "       \n",
    "       b) Proper motion is a stars velocity perpendicular to your line of sight and is typically\n",
    "       measured in both the RA and Declination directions. So, we can make a\n",
    "       cut on proper motion by removing stars that lie outside some proper\n",

    "3. The third cut we can make, of course, is on the distance to the stars.\n",
    "   Since we have Gaia data, we can use the star's parallax measurement as a\n",
    "   distance indicator. Similar to the velocity, we can simply give a\n",

    "1. This is called a \"Jupyter Notebook\" (said like Jupiter Notebook). It is a common tool used by astronomers to write and develop code for their research, primarily for looking at data. It runs Python code in small blocks, each like a mini program.  \n",
    "2. Each block of code is called a \"cell\", to run a cell you can click into it with your mouse and press `Shift-Enter`.\n",
    "3. When you run a cell, some will output plots/figures or text at the bottom of them. This will give you some information about the code and color magnitude diagrams. Other cells won't have any output, and that's okay!\n",
    "4. You may not understand fully what the code is doing and that is *totally okay*! This is as much about the astronomy as it is the code. Our goal for this notebook is to provide a soft introduction to Python code for those who have never seen it.\n",

Also since they are in a cluster, they should all be at about the same location and distance from Earth.

The other important factor that plays into the quality of the model fit to the data is the age of the cluster vs. the age of the modeled isochrone. Below, we show some isochrones on top of the data. But, we've changed the age and distance for different isochrones. How does this affect the model fit to the data?"

    "Before our final challenge, let's explore in a bit more detail how we actually got the data for M67. This way, you can tune different parameters if you'd like to narrow (or broaden) the focus of the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "We started with all of the data from Gaia, a space based telescope that is surveying starts within the entire Milky Way and parts of nearby galaxies. We then made the following cuts on the dataset:\n",
    "1. We performed a cone search centered on the coordinates of the cluster with a radius of 2 arcseconds. You can imagine that narrowing this radius will cut out some stars in the cluster and broadening it will possibly include some field stars that are not in the cluster. Of course, the 2 arcsecond radius is just what we thought was best, so you should definitely play around with it!\n",
    "2. You can imagine that, since the stars in a cluster are gravitationally bound, all of them should be moving on the sky at about the same velocity with some small amount of deviation. This allows us to tune two other parameters:\n",
    "   a. Radial velocity is a stars velocity towards or away from Earth. We can set an upper and lower limit on this to find stars that are moving similar to each other on the sky\n",
    "   b. Proper motion is a stars velocity across the sky and is typically measured in both the RA and Declination directions. So, we can make a cut on proper motion by removing stars that lie outside some proper motion delta centered at a proper motion RA and Declination.\n",
    "3. The third cut we can make, of course, is on the distance to the stars. Since we have Gaia data, we can use their parallax measurement. Similar to the velocity, we can simply give a minimum and maximum parallax for the stars in the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, you can change any of the numbers and see how it changes the amount of stars on the Color-Magnitude Diagram. Then, once you're done and feel like you understand how all of these different factors affect the color magnitude diagram of the cluster, you can move onto the final challenge!"

    "\n",
    "For our final challenge, try to model the data by changing the age of and distance of the isochrone to get the best fit to the data! (You can do this by changing the numbers next to `age=` and `distance=`). Fitting a dataset means finding the model that best represents the data. This can be done a variety of different ways, but for now, you can change the age and distance by hand to find the isochrone that looks the most like the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** I think we could/should use a different cluster for this. This will allow us to have the discussion above about what a turnoff means and to add a bit more to reinforce that all these stars are the same age. For example, we had talked about identifying which spectral type can be found at the turnoff and what this means about the age. I am unsure right now (at 5 am) how we represent that. This will also allow the students to set the cuts on their own, leading to more discussion about the choices beyond only age and distance. \n",

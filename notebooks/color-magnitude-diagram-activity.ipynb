    "4. You may not understand fully what the code is doing and that is *totally okay*! This is as much about the astronomy as it is the code. Our goal for this notebook is to provide a soft introduction to Python code for those who have never seen it.\n",

You can imagine that narrowing this radius will cut out some stars in the cluster and broadening it will possibly include some field stars that are not in the cluster. Of course, the 2 arcsecond radius is just what we thought was best, so you should definitely play around with it!\n",
    "2. You can imagine that, since the stars in a cluster are gravitationally bound, all of them should be moving on the sky at about the same velocity with some small amount of deviation. This allows us to tune two other parameters:\n",
    "   a. Radial velocity is a stars velocity towards or away from Earth. We can set an upper and lower limit on this to find stars that are moving similar to each other on the sky\n",
    "   b. Proper motion is a stars velocity across the sky and is typically measured in both the RA and Declination directions. So, we can make a cut on proper motion by removing stars that lie outside some proper motion delta centered at a proper motion RA and Declination.\n",
    "3. The third cut we can make, of course, is on the distance to the stars. Since we have Gaia data, we can use their parallax measurement. Similar to the velocity, we can simply give a minimum and maximum parallax for the stars in the cluster.\n",
    "\n",

    "For our final challenge, try to fit the data by changing the age of and distance to the cluster! (You can do this by changing the numbers next to `age=` and `distance=`). Fitting a dataset means finding the model that best represents the data. This can be done a variety of different ways, but for now, you can change the age and distance by hand to find the isochrone that looks the most like the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** I think we could/should use a different cluster for this. This will allow us to have the discussion above about what a turnoff means and to add a bit more to reinforce that all these stars are the same age. For example, we had talked about identifying which spectral type can be found at the turnoff and what this means about the age. I am unsure right now (at 5 am) how we represent that. This will also allow the students to set the cuts on their own, leading to more discussion about the choices beyond only age and distance. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: The age should be somewhere between 1 and 10 Gyrs and the distance should be between 400 and 1200 pc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternate hint: Think about what ages make sense. How old is the Universe? How old is the Sun? \n",
    "\n",
    "Alternate hint 2: These stars are within the Milky Way, so you can narrow down the maximum distance. The closest stars are 1pc away. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you find what you think is the best fitting isochrone, compare with your neighbors! What age and distance did you get? How did that compare to your neighbor? If they are different, why do you think that is?"

# October 23, 2024 Notes

* After a brief chat with Dave, Ed said that ASTR 250 seems like it will work 
* We need to assume no python knowledge, and to do this we discussed various things such as hiding different parts of code in the two iterations
* The main things to teach besides astrophysics were numpy, matplotlib, and pandas
  * More generally, I think we can consider extracting/loading data, data manipulation/processing, and data visualization. These are language independent 
  * Noah also mentioned good code practices by separating out our module from the notebook 
* We decided to use a github repo and Google Colab so that people don't need to install anything 
* First lesson could be H-R diagram related (consider Ruben example, how to change for majors), and second galaxy/AGN/cosmology depending on course topics
* Planned to meet on November 4 somewhere between 9-11am, pending Dave's availability. 

Homework: go over the H-R diagram example and think about changes, data we might like to include, and a "boss fight" that flips the script and changes the representation of the data.

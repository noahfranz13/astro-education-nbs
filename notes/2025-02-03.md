### Pre- and Post- Assessment brainstorming (Part 1 on programming experience)
_First page_
1. I feel like I currently have the knowledge and skills necessary to begin doing research in astronomy (1-4 scale)

_Second page (no back button)_
1. Rate your experience with programming
2. Choose any ofthe following you have experience with
   * Python
   * Java
   * C and/or C++
   * Javascript
   * HTML
   * MATLAB
   * R
   * Mathematica
   * Excel/Google Sheets
   * Other: 
3. Rate your experience with analyzing astronomy data (1-4 scale; 1 is none and 4 is a ton). And briefly describe your experiences.

_Third page_
1. Compare age in giant branch vs. age in main sequence question for all these stars in a cluster
2. Which of these is an older cluster
3. If you had an isochrone on a CMD as shown, what variables would you change and how to fit it to the data
4. Rank the temperature of these stars based on their color index number (one choice is "can not be determined")
5. Rank the apparent brightness of these main sequence stars given their color-magnitude diagram (one choice is "can not be determined")
6. Stars 1-3 are in a cluster together, rank their distance from Earth given the information in the table. 
   * Options: Ranking 1 is smallest to largest, Ranking 2 is largest to smallest, they're all the same distance, id rank largest to smallest, id rank smallest to largest

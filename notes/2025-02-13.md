# Notes from our meeting on Feb 13, 2025
Specifically notes on the notebook

* When they are labeling the main sequence with a letter "A", have them instead label the dimmest main sequence star
* For temperature keep hot and cold, but change to "small apparent magnitude" and "high apparent magnitude"
* Make sure I don't say "evolve along the main sequence" (Or similar) anywhere in the notebook
* Change the sentence about "An astute student" to "A special note"
* Reword the description of an isochrone from an evolutionary track to a "snapshot in time". Also make sure we mention distance and age. Restate it to not mention it as a single star evolving but as a current evolutionary state of a cluster.
* Remove exercise 3.1 but keep the example plots and text so Jacob can talk about it in the video
* Stop Here needs to be moved to after 4.1
* Write some code to display a ball falling over time (y vs. t plot) using the function that Jacob will fill in.
  * write this using the @test decorator that I've already written so that the plot just appears whenever they run the cell

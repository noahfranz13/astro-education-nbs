- We agreed to meet with Kate and Dan, but we should come with a prototype notebook

- What assumptions will we make about the students? 
1. Do they have gmail accounts? 
2. No integrals or matrix formulas, keep things to calculus I level. 
3. Use results of Ed's survey about computer knowledge
4. They will know main "groups" of stars (Main sequence, white dwarves, asymptotic giants, etc.)
5. They will know the rough evolutionary path
6. They will be familiar with Supernovae vs White Dwarves vs Neutron Stars as end of life for stars
7. We may need to explain clustering

- We agreed to do some think-pair-share questions at the beginning to explain clustering and metallicity and to remind them of distance modulus and colors. 

- We briefly discussed the injection/inclusion of outliers, such as bad pixels, galaxies, and/or foreground stars.

### Learning outcomes
1. Students should be able to relate color index to temperature
2. Use color indices to infer properties of the star
3. Identify main types of stars
4. Understand how distance, metallicity, and age affect an isochrone

- Noah suggested a possible "boss fight" of getting an isochrone out in absolute magnitude and having to convert it to apparent to match to the observations.

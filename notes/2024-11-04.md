1. We discussed that approx 90% of the students have a laptop available for such an activity, and that pairing up for those who don't would be no 
2. Dave will send us the semester schedule so we can pin down the timing of the two units
   a. CMD in march (after spring break?)
   b. (active) galaxies in late April
3. Color-Mag Diagram thoughts
   a. Give the students a "bad" dataset so that they can make meaningful choices in processing
   b. This includes things such as outliers and built-in "mistakes" in the plotting
   c. An example of built-in mistakes is wrong/weird axes
   d. We also discussed setting the CMD extraction radius as a way to have the students make meaningful choices
4. The second topic is still unclear we briefly discussed
   a. AGN spectra (broad/narrow lines)
   b. Hubble's Law and/or distance ladder 
5. Noah sent around a when2meet for our next meeting
